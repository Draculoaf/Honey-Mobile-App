    introduction: [
      "In this lesson, you will learn the various ways that things can be cut, and how to do it. This includes dicing, chiffonade, julienne and mincing. I suggest that you use a sharp non-serrated knife for this exercise, and choose veggies such as onions for dicing, leafy herbs for chiffonade, carrots for julienne and garlic gloves for mincing. Whilst these cuts can be applied to different vegetables, I have found that the above suggested ones, are the easiest to practice with",

    instructions: [

        "Dicing:",

        "This method is used to ensure that the ingredient is cut in a way which allows for all the pieces to be equal sizes so that it can cook evenly. I also like to call this method the cubing method, because the cut ingredient’s pieces are in the shape of cubes.",

        "- Step 1 | Taking your onion, cut the onion in half through the root end, and place the onion flat side down.",

        "- Step 3 | Starting at the tip again, make vertical slices towards the root, without cutting the root.",
        "- Step 4 | Finally, make vertical cuts from the tip of the onion to the root of the onion, such that your cuts in this step are perpendicular to the cuts made in step 3.",
        "- Step 5 | Repeat for the other half.",
        "Note: The more vertical and horizontal slices you make, the smaller your diced vegetable pieces will be.",
      ],
      [
        "Chiffonade:",

        "This method is primarily used with soft leafy vegetables so that it can be sliced with ease, and without losing the flavour on the chopping board. ",

        "********This example uses basil leaves********",

        "- Step 1 | Stack the basil leaves on top of each other.",
        "- Step 2 | Roll the stack of basil leaves into a tight cigar shape.",

      [

        "- Step 1 | Cut your carrot into 5cm segments (about 4 fingers).",

Mincing makes the ingredient taste more powerful. If you over mince your ingredient, you are likely to end up with a thick paste.",

        "Dough Hook:",

        "The dough hook is usually either c-shaped or spiral shaped, and this attachment assists in kneading dough. The main difference between the c-shape and the spiral shape, is that the spiral shape mixes the dough on the bottom of the stand mixer bowl, whereas the c-shaped attachment mixes the dough on the sides of the bowl.",

      [
        "Flat beater:",

      ],
      [
        "Whisk:",

        " Very similar to the hand held whisk, this attachment is perfect for aerating light mixtures. It can also be used for lighter frostings, but is particularly useful when making items such as meringues which require thoroughly beaten egg whites.",
